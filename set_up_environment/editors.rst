Text editors and IDEs
---------------------

The course content, as mentioned in previous chapters, consist of several **RST** files. Therefore, you are going to need 
a versatile and powerful :abbr:`text editor (A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such
programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software.)`. We suggest using text editors with advanced functionalities,
such as Vim, or Emacs. Nevertheless, we advocate the use of :abbr:`IDEs (An integrated development environment (IDE) is a
software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE
normally consists of at least a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger.)` over any text editors, 
especially VS Code and the `A+ Tools extension <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jaguarfi.aplus-tools>`_.

In any case, we will provide you with a list of some of text editors and IDEs that are well know for being used to write
RST documents. You can access each link and read more about each of these tools and choose the one that best suits your 
needs.

For GNU/Linux environment, some **simple** text editors are:

* `Kate <https://kate-editor.org/>`_
* Mousepad included in the `Xfce Desktop Environment <https://xfce.org/>`_
* `Gedit <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit>`_.
* `Vim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_
* `Emacs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs>`_

For windows a **simple** text editor is:

* `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_

Some more advanced and cross-platform editors are:

* `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_
* `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ (Recommended by the A+ team)

.. warning::

  * Do **not** use word processors such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice writer. Their formatting commands are basically
    useless when one must edit plain text files.
  * Some of the most advanced editors might have a steep learning curve, but once you have mastered the editor's
    features, your productivity will increase.
  * The **Aplus tools** extension in VS Code, provides a series of features that makes the creation of the courses
    painless.
