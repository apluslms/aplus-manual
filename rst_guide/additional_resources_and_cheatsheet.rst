Once you start working with RST, you will become curious about the language's flexibility, and most

the official documentation as the main source of knowledge. Nevertheless, there is always other
sources of knowledge that could help you solve specific problems or implement more advanced
directives. So do not hesitate to explore and find the most suitable language features for you.
