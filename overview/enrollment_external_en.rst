Enrollment for external students
================================

This chapter is hidden from students.
The enrollment exercise is normally opened as an independent exercise instead
of embedded within the chapter.
Course staff may view this chapter and the embedded exercise too.

The next questionnaire is only for external students and should be removed
from the course if the course is only offered to internal students.

  Enroll to the course by filling in this questionnaire.
  Some questions may become hidden based on answers on previous questions, thus
  the numbering of the questions may have gaps.
