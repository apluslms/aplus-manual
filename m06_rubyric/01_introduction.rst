Rubyric
-------

Written personalized feedback can sometimes be more useful to students than
pure numerical grades, especially when talking about certain exercise types,
such as essays and bigger projects. Written feedback helps students to notice
what exactly is wrong with the answers and students can take the feedback into
consideration and use it to improve their answers next time.
`Rubyric <https://rubyric.cs.hut.fi>`_ is an online tool which strives to make
giving written feedback easier and faster using predefined feedback snippets, 
`rubrics <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubric_(academic)>`_. Teachers can
create assessment rubrics, which reviewers use as a base to review submissions.
Rubrics contain predefined assessment criteria, common feedback phrases and
corresponding grades and points. Reviewer chooses suitable phrases, can
freely edit the chosen phrases, and add their own comments in between to create
feedback for students.

Rubyric allows you to do two different kinds of reviews: *plain text reviews*
and *annotation reviews*. Plain text reviews are constructed by putting chosen
phrases one after another and modifying the text. Annotation review allows the
reviewer to drag comments on the submission where they are shown. Annotation
review allows reviewer to add comment on the exact place they want to comment
on.

Standalone Rubyric vs. A+ integration with Haka and LTI login
.............................................................

The Rubyric service can be used as is: the students go to the Rubyric web page
and submit their answers there, and the teachers use the same web page to grade
the exercises. However, if your course is also using the A+ learning management
system, it is possible to integrate Rubyric with the A+ page of your course.

It is possible to login to Rubyric through *Haka login* as well as login from the
*A+ service* with the *LTI protocol*. In this manual we will be talking about LTI
configuration in Rubyric every once in a while. If your course uses A+, note
that Rubyric courses can be connected to A+ regardless of login method.
On the other hand, if you wish to use Rubyric without connecting
it to A+, you can ignore the LTI related parts in this manual and focus on
general Rubyric instructions. In the following chapters we will discuss how to
get started with Rubyric, define rubrics and review assignments.

.. warning::

  At Rubyric the account you login with Haka login is not the same account you
  are using when you login through A+. Which means you might not have access to
  same courses with both login methods.
