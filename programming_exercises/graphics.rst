Exercises with 2D computer graphics
===================================

It is possible to create programming exercises where the student's program
creates a picture as an output.

Python-grader-utils with PNG files
----------------------------------

Using mooc-grader inside a Docker container has two restrictions.

First, there is no display inside the grading container. The
`grading-python-web <https://github.com/apluslms/grading-python-web>`_
container is an exception.

Second, mooc-grader gives the grading results and feedback to A+ as HTML
document. The HTML document cannot refer to any image files inside the grading
container, because that container is shut down before mooc-grader hands the
results off to A+. Therefore any pictures that must be shown to student must be
*encoded into the HTML response* using `Data URI scheme
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>`_. In plain English, this means
that the image file is converted into text that is placed in the HTML document.

The following exercise is an example on how this is done.

The turtle exercise
...................

The Python programming language has a simple graphics library called
`turtle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html>`_. One can use the
library with command ``import turtle``. The drawing is analogy of a turtle
which moves leaving a line behind. A new turtle is created with command
``turtle.Turtle()``. After that, one can move the turtle with methods
``forward()``, ``left()``, and ``right()``.

Example:

.. code-block:: python

    import turtle
    t = turtle.Turtle()
    t.speed(0)          # maximum speed

    t.forward(8)
    t.right(45)
    t.forward(5)
    t.left(30)
    t.forward(15)

Your task is to draw a pattern with 1000 steps such that the turtle
alternatingly moves 5 units forward and then turns 90 degrees either left
or right.

The direction of the *n*\ th turn is determined with the following
method. First divide the number *n* by 2 until the result is an odd
number. Then, if the modulus of that number with four is 1, turn to the
right. Otherwise, turn to the left.

.. submit:: turtles 100
  :config: exercises/turtle_python/config.yaml
  :title: Turtle


#. Create a function ``get_direction()``, which takes the number of the turn and returns the direction, either "right" or "left".
#. One can implement ``get_direction()`` for example with a ``while`` loop.
#. Notice that in the first turn :math:`n=1`.
#. One step is five units forward and then a 90 degree turn.
#. To accelerate the drawing animation, you may use the ``speed()`` method of the turtle library.

Here is the result your program should produce.

.. image:: /images/turtle.png


Commentary on the turtle exercise
.................................

This is an actual exercise for the Aalto university course
`CS-A1130 Tietotekniikka sovelluksissa (Applications of computing) <https://courses.aalto.fi/course/CS-A1130>`_.

The code for this exercise is found in the directory ``exercises/turtle_python``.
Try to submit the file ``model.py``. The another file ``turtles.py`` is the
code template for the student.

The exercise draws
`the dragon curve fractal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_curve>`_
iteratively.

The student uses the real turtle library when testing their solution.
The grader software uses another libraries, ``simpleturtle.py`` and
``minipng.py``, with minimal functionality to implement the turtle graphics
for the exercise and creating a PNG file.

Finally, in ``minipng.Image.write_to_file()`` the result is written to
a Base64 encoded PNG file. Then Python-grader-utils uses the
feedback template ``feedback_plot_png.html`` which has the following lines:

.. code-block:: html

  <img src="data:image/png;base64,
  {% include 'turtles.png.base64' %}
  " alt="Graphics" />

That piece of code inserts the Base64 encoded PNG image into the HTML
using the `Data URI scheme <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme>`_.
