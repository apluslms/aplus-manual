Text editors and IDEs
---------------------

To edit the files in the course directory, like the *RST* files, you need a :abbr:`text editor (A text editor is a type of computer program that edits plain text. Such programs are sometimes known as "notepad" software.)`. There is an infinite number of text editors available. Nonetheless, we suggest using text editors with advanced functionalities, such as VS Code, Atom or perhaps Vim. But, what is really important about text editors is knowing how to use them. It is imperative to learn how to commenting multiple lines, how to change the indentation of multiple lines, how to show line numbers, the basic searching and replacing text functionalities, and of course memorise some of the most common shortcuts. For example `VS Code shortcuts <https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/keybindings#_keyboard-shortcuts-reference>`_.

For GNU/Linux environment, some **simple** text editors are:

* `Kate <https://kate-editor.org/>`_
* Mousepad included in the `Xfce Desktop Environment <https://xfce.org/>`_
* `Gedit <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Gedit>`_.

For windows a **simple** text editor is:

* `Notepad++ <https://notepad-plus-plus.org/>`_ 

Some more advanced and cross-platform editors are:

* `Atom <https://atom.io/>`_ 
* `VS Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`_ (Recommended by the A+ team)
* `Emacs <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emacs>`_ 
* `Vim <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)>`_

.. warning:: 

  * Do **not** use word processors such as Microsoft Word or LibreOffice writer. Their formatting commands are basically useless when one must edit plain text files.
  * Some of the most advanced editors might have a steep learning curve.
  * The **Aplus tools** extension in VS Code, provides a series of features that makes the creation of the courses painless.
